3. About
--------

citygml4j is a Java class library and API for facilitating work with the
City Geography Markup Language (CityGML). It makes it easy to read, process, and
write CityGML datasets, and to develop CityGML-aware software applications.

Feature list:
* Full support for CityGML version 2.0.0 and 1.0.0
  (read-only support for CityGML 0.4.0)
* Support for CityGML specific subset of GML 3.1.1
* Support for the eXtensible Address Language (xAL)
* Support for user-defined CityGML Application Domain Extensions (ADE)

CityGML is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange
of semantic 3D city models. It is an application schema for the Geography Markup
Language version 3.1.1 (GML3), the extendible international standard for spatial
data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211.
The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the
basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model.

CityGML is an international OGC standard and can be used free of charge.

5. How to use it
----------------

Simply put the citygml4j-2.5.0.jar library file and its mandatory dependencies
from the "lib" folder on your classpath to start developing with citygml4j.
Have fun :-)

citygml4j is also available as Maven artifact: 

  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.citygml4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>citygml4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0</version>
  </dependency>

A collection of sample programs that demonstrate the use of the library are
provided in the "samples" folder. The sample programs are organized into
subfolders, each addressing a different use case of citygml4j. Ant build
files are provided to easily run the sample programs.
